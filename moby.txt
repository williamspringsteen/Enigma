CALL ME ISHMAEL SOME YEARS AGONEVER MIND HOW LONG PRECISELYHAVING
LITTLE OR NO MONEY IN MY PURSE AND NOTHING PARTICULAR TO INTEREST ME ON
SHORE I THOUGHT I WOULD SAIL ABOUT A LITTLE AND SEE THE WATERY PART OF
THE WORLD IT IS A WAY I HAVE OF DRIVING OFF THE SPLEEN AND REGULATING
THE CIRCULATION WHENEVER I FIND MYSELF GROWING GRIM ABOUT THE MOUTH
WHENEVER IT IS A DAMP DRIZZLY NOVEMBER IN MY SOUL WHENEVER I FIND
MYSELF INVOLUNTARILY PAUSING BEFORE COFFIN WAREHOUSES AND BRINGING UP
THE REAR OF EVERY FUNERAL I MEET AND ESPECIALLY WHENEVER MY HYPOS GET
SUCH AN UPPER HAND OF ME THAT IT REQUIRES A STRONG MORAL PRINCIPLE TO
PREVENT ME FROM DELIBERATELY STEPPING INTO THE STREET AND METHODICALLY
KNOCKING PEOPLES HATS OFFTHEN I ACCOUNT IT HIGH TIME TO GET TO SEA
AS SOON AS I CAN THIS IS MY SUBSTITUTE FOR PISTOL AND BALL WITH A
PHILOSOPHICAL FLOURISH CATO THROWS HIMSELF UPON HIS SWORD I QUIETLY
TAKE TO THE SHIP THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THIS IF THEY BUT KNEW
IT ALMOST ALL MEN IN THEIR DEGREE SOME TIME OR OTHER CHERISH VERY
NEARLY THE SAME FEELINGS TOWARDS THE OCEAN WITH ME

THERE NOW IS YOUR INSULAR CITY OF THE MANHATTOES BELTED ROUND BY
WHARVES AS INDIAN ISLES BY CORAL REEFSCOMMERCE SURROUNDS IT WITH
HER SURF RIGHT AND LEFT THE STREETS TAKE YOU WATERWARD ITS EXTREME
DOWNTOWN IS THE BATTERY WHERE THAT NOBLE MOLE IS WASHED BY WAVES AND
COOLED BY BREEZES WHICH A FEW HOURS PREVIOUS WERE OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
LOOK AT THE CROWDS OF WATERGAZERS THERE

CIRCUMAMBULATE THE CITY OF A DREAMY SABBATH AFTERNOON GO FROM CORLEARS
HOOK TO COENTIES SLIP AND FROM THENCE BY WHITEHALL NORTHWARD WHAT
DO YOU SEEPOSTED LIKE SILENT SENTINELS ALL AROUND THE TOWN STAND
  THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF MORTAL MEN FIXED IN OCEAN REVERIES SOME
  LEANING AGAINST THE SPILES SOME SEATED UPON THE PIERHEADS SOME
  LOOKING OVER THE BULWARKS OF SHIPS FROM CHINA SOME HIGH ALOFT IN THE
  RIGGING AS IF STRIVING TO GET A STILL BETTER SEAWARD PEEP BUT THESE
  ARE ALL LANDSMEN OF WEEK DAYS PENT UP IN LATH AND PLASTERTIED TO
  COUNTERS NAILED TO BENCHES CLINCHED TO DESKS HOW THEN IS THIS ARE
  THE GREEN FIELDS GONE WHAT DO THEY HERE

  BUT LOOK HERE COME MORE CROWDS PACING STRAIGHT FOR THE WATER AND
  SEEMINGLY BOUND FOR A DIVE STRANGE NOTHING WILL CONTENT THEM BUT THE
  EXTREMEST LIMIT OF THE LAND LOITERING UNDER THE SHADY LEE OF YONDER
  WAREHOUSES WILL NOT SUFFICE NO THEY MUST GET JUST AS NIGH THE WATER
  AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN WITHOUT FALLING IN AND THERE THEY STANDMILES OF
  THEMLEAGUES INLANDERS ALL THEY COME FROM LANES AND ALLEYS STREETS
  AND AVENUESNORTH EAST SOUTH AND WEST YET HERE THEY ALL UNITE
  TELL ME DOES THE MAGNETIC VIRTUE OF THE NEEDLES OF THE COMPASSES OF ALL
  THOSE SHIPS ATTRACT THEM THITHER

  ONCE MORE SAY YOU ARE IN THE COUNTRY IN SOME HIGH LAND OF LAKES TAKE
  ALMOST ANY PATH YOU PLEASE AND TEN TO ONE IT CARRIES YOU DOWN IN A
  DALE AND LEAVES YOU THERE BY A POOL IN THE STREAM THERE IS MAGIC
  IN IT LET THE MOST ABSENTMINDED OF MEN BE PLUNGED IN HIS DEEPEST
  REVERIESSTAND THAT MAN ON HIS LEGS SET HIS FEET AGOING AND HE WILL
  INFALLIBLY LEAD YOU TO WATER IF WATER THERE BE IN ALL THAT REGION
  SHOULD YOU EVER BE ATHIRST IN THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT TRY THIS
  EXPERIMENT IF YOUR CARAVAN HAPPEN TO BE SUPPLIED WITH A METAPHYSICAL
  PROFESSOR YES AS EVERY ONE KNOWS MEDITATION AND WATER ARE WEDDED FOR
  EVER

  BUT HERE IS AN ARTIST HE DESIRES TO PAINT YOU THE DREAMIEST SHADIEST
  QUIETEST MOST ENCHANTING BIT OF ROMANTIC LANDSCAPE IN ALL THE VALLEY OF
  THE SACO WHAT IS THE CHIEF ELEMENT HE EMPLOYS THERE STAND HIS TREES
  EACH WITH A HOLLOW TRUNK AS IF A HERMIT AND A CRUCIFIX WERE WITHIN AND
  HERE SLEEPS HIS MEADOW AND THERE SLEEP HIS CATTLE AND UP FROM YONDER
  COTTAGE GOES A SLEEPY SMOKE DEEP INTO DISTANT WOODLANDS WINDS A
  MAZY WAY REACHING TO OVERLAPPING SPURS OF MOUNTAINS BATHED IN THEIR
  HILLSIDE BLUE BUT THOUGH THE PICTURE LIES THUS TRANCED AND THOUGH
  THIS PINETREE SHAKES DOWN ITS SIGHS LIKE LEAVES UPON THIS SHEPHERDS
  HEAD YET ALL WERE VAIN UNLESS THE SHEPHERDS EYE WERE FIXED UPON THE
  MAGIC STREAM BEFORE HIM GO VISIT THE PRAIRIES IN JUNE WHEN FOR SCORES
  ON SCORES OF MILES YOU WADE KNEEDEEP AMONG TIGERLILIESWHAT IS THE
  ONE CHARM WANTINGWATERTHERE IS NOT A DROP OF WATER THERE WERE
  NIAGARA BUT A CATARACT OF SAND WOULD YOU TRAVEL YOUR THOUSAND MILES TO
  SEE IT WHY DID THE POOR POET OF TENNESSEE UPON SUDDENLY RECEIVING TWO
  HANDFULS OF SILVER DELIBERATE WHETHER TO BUY HIM A COAT WHICH HE SADLY
  NEEDED OR INVEST HIS MONEY IN A PEDESTRIAN TRIP TO ROCKAWAY BEACH WHY
  IS ALMOST EVERY ROBUST HEALTHY BOY WITH A ROBUST HEALTHY SOUL IN HIM AT
  SOME TIME OR OTHER CRAZY TO GO TO SEA WHY UPON YOUR FIRST VOYAGE AS A
  PASSENGER DID YOU YOURSELF FEEL SUCH A MYSTICAL VIBRATION WHEN FIRST
  TOLD THAT YOU AND YOUR SHIP WERE NOW OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND WHY DID THE
  OLD PERSIANS HOLD THE SEA HOLY WHY DID THE GREEKS GIVE IT A SEPARATE
  DEITY AND OWN BROTHER OF JOVE SURELY ALL THIS IS NOT WITHOUT MEANING
  AND STILL DEEPER THE MEANING OF THAT STORY OF NARCISSUS WHO BECAUSE
  HE COULD NOT GRASP THE TORMENTING MILD IMAGE HE SAW IN THE FOUNTAIN
  PLUNGED INTO IT AND WAS DROWNED BUT THAT SAME IMAGE WE OURSELVES SEE
  IN ALL RIVERS AND OCEANS IT IS THE IMAGE OF THE UNGRASPABLE PHANTOM OF
  LIFE AND THIS IS THE KEY TO IT ALL

  NOW WHEN I SAY THAT I AM IN THE HABIT OF GOING TO SEA WHENEVER I BEGIN
  TO GROW HAZY ABOUT THE EYES AND BEGIN TO BE OVER CONSCIOUS OF MY LUNGS
  I DO NOT MEAN TO HAVE IT INFERRED THAT I EVER GO TO SEA AS A PASSENGER
  FOR TO GO AS A PASSENGER YOU MUST NEEDS HAVE A PURSE AND A PURSE IS
  BUT A RAG UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN IT BESIDES PASSENGERS GET
  SEASICKGROW QUARRELSOMEDONT SLEEP OF NIGHTSDO NOT ENJOY
  THEMSELVES MUCH AS A GENERAL THINGNO I NEVER GO AS A PASSENGER
  NOR THOUGH I AM SOMETHING OF A SALT DO I EVER GO TO SEA AS A
  COMMODORE OR A CAPTAIN OR A COOK I ABANDON THE GLORY AND DISTINCTION
  OF SUCH OFFICES TO THOSE WHO LIKE THEM FOR MY PART I ABOMINATE ALL
  HONOURABLE RESPECTABLE TOILS TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF EVERY KIND
  WHATSOEVER IT IS QUITE AS MUCH AS I CAN DO TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF
  WITHOUT TAKING CARE OF SHIPS BARQUES BRIGS SCHOONERS AND WHAT NOT
  AND AS FOR GOING AS COOKTHOUGH I CONFESS THERE IS CONSIDERABLE GLORY
  IN THAT A COOK BEING A SORT OF OFFICER ON SHIPBOARDYET SOMEHOW
  I NEVER FANCIED BROILING FOWLSTHOUGH ONCE BROILED JUDICIOUSLY
  BUTTERED AND JUDGMATICALLY SALTED AND PEPPERED THERE IS NO ONE WHO
  WILL SPEAK MORE RESPECTFULLY NOT TO SAY REVERENTIALLY OF A BROILED
  FOWL THAN I WILL IT IS OUT OF THE IDOLATROUS DOTINGS OF THE OLD
  EGYPTIANS UPON BROILED IBIS AND ROASTED RIVER HORSE THAT YOU SEE THE
  MUMMIES OF THOSE CREATURES IN THEIR HUGE BAKEHOUSES THE PYRAMIDS

  NO WHEN I GO TO SEA I GO AS A SIMPLE SAILOR RIGHT BEFORE THE MAST
  PLUMB DOWN INTO THE FORECASTLE ALOFT THERE TO THE ROYAL MASTHEAD
  TRUE THEY RATHER ORDER ME ABOUT SOME AND MAKE ME JUMP FROM SPAR TO
  SPAR LIKE A GRASSHOPPER IN A MAY MEADOW AND AT FIRST THIS SORT
  OF THING IS UNPLEASANT ENOUGH IT TOUCHES ONES SENSE OF HONOUR
  PARTICULARLY IF YOU COME OF AN OLD ESTABLISHED FAMILY IN THE LAND THE
  VAN RENSSELAERS OR RANDOLPHS OR HARDICANUTES AND MORE THAN ALL
  IF JUST PREVIOUS TO PUTTING YOUR HAND INTO THE TARPOT YOU HAVE BEEN
    LORDING IT AS A COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER MAKING THE TALLEST BOYS STAND
    IN AWE OF YOU THE TRANSITION IS A KEEN ONE I ASSURE YOU FROM A
    SCHOOLMASTER TO A SAILOR AND REQUIRES A STRONG DECOCTION OF SENECA AND
    THE STOICS TO ENABLE YOU TO GRIN AND BEAR IT BUT EVEN THIS WEARS OFF IN
    TIME

    WHAT OF IT IF SOME OLD HUNKS OF A SEACAPTAIN ORDERS ME TO GET A BROOM
    AND SWEEP DOWN THE DECKS WHAT DOES THAT INDIGNITY AMOUNT TO WEIGHED
    I MEAN IN THE SCALES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT DO YOU THINK THE ARCHANGEL
    GABRIEL THINKS ANYTHING THE LESS OF ME BECAUSE I PROMPTLY AND
    RESPECTFULLY OBEY THAT OLD HUNKS IN THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE WHO AINT
    A SLAVE TELL ME THAT WELL THEN HOWEVER THE OLD SEACAPTAINS MAY
    ORDER ME ABOUTHOWEVER THEY MAY THUMP AND PUNCH ME ABOUT I HAVE THE
    SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT IT IS ALL RIGHT THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS
    ONE WAY OR OTHER SERVED IN MUCH THE SAME WAYEITHER IN A PHYSICAL
    OR METAPHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW THAT IS AND SO THE UNIVERSAL THUMP IS
    PASSED ROUND AND ALL HANDS SHOULD RUB EACH OTHERS SHOULDERBLADES AND
    BE CONTENT

    AGAIN I ALWAYS GO TO SEA AS A SAILOR BECAUSE THEY MAKE A POINT OF
    PAYING ME FOR MY TROUBLE WHEREAS THEY NEVER PAY PASSENGERS A SINGLE
    PENNY THAT I EVER HEARD OF ON THE CONTRARY PASSENGERS THEMSELVES MUST
    PAY AND THERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD BETWEEN PAYING
    AND BEING PAID THE ACT OF PAYING IS PERHAPS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE
    INFLICTION THAT THE TWO ORCHARD THIEVES ENTAILED UPON US BUT BEING
    PAIDWHAT WILL COMPARE WITH IT THE URBANE ACTIVITY WITH WHICH A MAN
    RECEIVES MONEY IS REALLY MARVELLOUS CONSIDERING THAT WE SO EARNESTLY
    BELIEVE MONEY TO BE THE ROOT OF ALL EARTHLY ILLS AND THAT ON NO ACCOUNT
    CAN A MONIED MAN ENTER HEAVEN AH HOW CHEERFULLY WE CONSIGN OURSELVES
    TO PERDITION

    FINALLY I ALWAYS GO TO SEA AS A SAILOR BECAUSE OF THE WHOLESOME
    EXERCISE AND PURE AIR OF THE FORECASTLE DECK FOR AS IN THIS WORLD
    HEAD WINDS ARE FAR MORE PREVALENT THAN WINDS FROM ASTERN THAT IS
    IF YOU NEVER VIOLATE THE PYTHAGOREAN MAXIM SO FOR THE MOST PART THE
      COMMODORE ON THE QUARTERDECK GETS HIS ATMOSPHERE AT SECOND HAND FROM
      THE SAILORS ON THE FORECASTLE HE THINKS HE BREATHES IT FIRST BUT NOT
      SO IN MUCH THE SAME WAY DO THE COMMONALTY LEAD THEIR LEADERS IN MANY
      OTHER THINGS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE LEADERS LITTLE SUSPECT IT
      BUT WHEREFORE IT WAS THAT AFTER HAVING REPEATEDLY SMELT THE SEA AS A
      MERCHANT SAILOR I SHOULD NOW TAKE IT INTO MY HEAD TO GO ON A WHALING
      VOYAGE THIS THE INVISIBLE POLICE OFFICER OF THE FATES WHO HAS THE
      CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE OF ME AND SECRETLY DOGS ME AND INFLUENCES ME
      IN SOME UNACCOUNTABLE WAYHE CAN BETTER ANSWER THAN ANY ONE ELSE AND
      DOUBTLESS MY GOING ON THIS WHALING VOYAGE FORMED PART OF THE GRAND
      PROGRAMME OF PROVIDENCE THAT WAS DRAWN UP A LONG TIME AGO IT CAME IN AS
      A SORT OF BRIEF INTERLUDE AND SOLO BETWEEN MORE EXTENSIVE PERFORMANCES
      I TAKE IT THAT THIS PART OF THE BILL MUST HAVE RUN SOMETHING LIKE THIS


      GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES

      WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL

      BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN


      THOUGH I CANNOT TELL WHY IT WAS EXACTLY THAT THOSE STAGE MANAGERS THE
      FATES PUT ME DOWN FOR THIS SHABBY PART OF A WHALING VOYAGE WHEN OTHERS
      WERE SET DOWN FOR MAGNIFICENT PARTS IN HIGH TRAGEDIES AND SHORT AND
      EASY PARTS IN GENTEEL COMEDIES AND JOLLY PARTS IN FARCESTHOUGH
      I CANNOT TELL WHY THIS WAS EXACTLY YET NOW THAT I RECALL ALL THE
      CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK I CAN SEE A LITTLE INTO THE SPRINGS AND MOTIVES
      WHICH BEING CUNNINGLY PRESENTED TO ME UNDER VARIOUS DISGUISES INDUCED
      ME TO SET ABOUT PERFORMING THE PART I DID BESIDES CAJOLING ME INTO THE
      DELUSION THAT IT WAS A CHOICE RESULTING FROM MY OWN UNBIASED FREEWILL
      AND DISCRIMINATING JUDGMENT

      CHIEF AMONG THESE MOTIVES WAS THE OVERWHELMING IDEA OF THE GREAT
      WHALE HIMSELF SUCH A PORTENTOUS AND MYSTERIOUS MONSTER ROUSED ALL MY
      CURIOSITY THEN THE WILD AND DISTANT SEAS WHERE HE ROLLED HIS ISLAND
      BULK THE UNDELIVERABLE NAMELESS PERILS OF THE WHALE THESE WITH ALL
      THE ATTENDING MARVELS OF A THOUSAND PATAGONIAN SIGHTS AND SOUNDS HELPED
      TO SWAY ME TO MY WISH WITH OTHER MEN PERHAPS SUCH THINGS WOULD NOT
      HAVE BEEN INDUCEMENTS BUT AS FOR ME I AM TORMENTED WITH AN EVERLASTING
      ITCH FOR THINGS REMOTE I LOVE TO SAIL FORBIDDEN SEAS AND LAND ON
      BARBAROUS COASTS NOT IGNORING WHAT IS GOOD I AM QUICK TO PERCEIVE A
      HORROR AND COULD STILL BE SOCIAL WITH ITWOULD THEY LET MESINCE IT
      IS BUT WELL TO BE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH ALL THE INMATES OF THE PLACE
      ONE LODGES IN

      BY REASON OF THESE THINGS THEN THE WHALING VOYAGE WAS WELCOME THE
      GREAT FLOODGATES OF THE WONDERWORLD SWUNG OPEN AND IN THE WILD
      CONCEITS THAT SWAYED ME TO MY PURPOSE TWO AND TWO THERE FLOATED INTO
      MY INMOST SOUL ENDLESS PROCESSIONS OF THE WHALE AND MID MOST OF THEM
      ALL ONE GRAND HOODED PHANTOM LIKE A SNOW HILL IN THE AIR
